## Reflections on this assignment

Learning React was interesting to me because it seems to have great potential for allowing for interesting and effective user interactions. As we were learning about the different ways to work with React, I already had ideas about projects to build with it in the future. It was exciting to see so much potential in a library I'm just starting to learn about.

Working with webpack for this project was a challenge, but I think ended up being worthwhile, especially now that I have a config file for it that works for me.

I challenged myself to try and do as much of the CSS for this project without having to look things up all the time. Other than the animations, I pretty much succeeded. Definitely a sign for me that practice is the key to learning a language, and that my practice has been paying off.
